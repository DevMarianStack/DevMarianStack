## About Me
I'm a 13-year-old developer into Unity and Discord bots. I donâ€™t just play gamesâ€”I create them. If itâ€™s tech, Iâ€™m all in.

- **Unity Dev**: Working on exciting games.
- **Discord Bots**: Making servers more fun with custom bots.
- **Learning**: Always improving, never staying basic.

## Projects
